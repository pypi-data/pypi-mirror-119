# Python boilerplate code generator to easily start building API\'s (pyapibp)

This python script generates a folder structure along all default files for an API framework in the current directory, optionally creating a new one.

Currently supported frameworks:

- Flask

Work in progress:

- FastAPI
- Django

## Short backstory

When getting started on building an API, I found myself looking up an older project, copying the folder structure along the files and their contents. Then, remembering what environment variables I should include in the .env and their defaults for a local project. All in all, it was repetitive and annoying. Then let's be honest, why spend 5 minutes doing a repetitive task every now and then if you can spend 3 hours trying to automate it. Anyway, I hope you find this tool useful, and if you did, leave a star just so I know you found this tool useful.

## Installation

Installation is done using pip using the following command:

    pip install pyapibp

## Usage

In the desired folder, run the following command:

    $ pyapibp

That's about it, follow the instructions, choose your options and tada, you are ready to code!

I will write a more detailed description of the options after adding more frameworks, flags *etc... etc...*, but for now, enjoy.
