# B.CfnS3LargeDeployment

**b-cfn-s3-large-deployment** - AWS CDK custom resource that handles large files deployment to S3 bucket.

### Description

This custom resource is deploys local files or S3 bucket objects to a destination bucket retaining their file-system 
hierarchy.

Two types of deployment sources are available:

- `BucketDeploymentSource` - uses another S3 bucket object(-s) as source for the deployment to a destination bucket. 
  Only files up to 5TB are supported due to S3 bucket limitations;
- `AssetDeploymentSource` - uses `aws-cdk.aws-s3-assets` lib to deploy local files as .zip files to assets bucket from 
  which extracted contents are moved to the destination bucket. Asset files more than 2GB in size are not supported.

See "Known limits" sections below for more information on this resource limitations.

This resource implementation is based on GitHub pull-request https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/15220.

### Usage & Examples

```python
from aws_cdk.core import App, Stack, Construct
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket

from b_cfn_s3_large_deployment.resource import S3LargeDeploymentResource
from b_cfn_s3_large_deployment.deployment_props import DeploymentProps
from b_cfn_s3_large_deployment.deployment_source import AssetDeploymentSource, BucketDeploymentSource


class ExampleStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct):
        super().__init__(...)

        S3LargeDeploymentResource(
            scope=self,
            name='ExampleLargeDeployment',
            props=DeploymentProps(
                sources=[
                    AssetDeploymentSource(path='/path/to/your/local/directory'),
                    AssetDeploymentSource(path='/path/to/your/local/zip/file.zip'),
                    BucketDeploymentSource(
                      bucket=..., 
                      zip_object_key='your-source-bucket-object-key'
                    ),
                    ...
                ],
                destination_bucket=Bucket(...),
                ...
            )
        )
        
        ...

        
app = App()
ExampleStack(app, "ExampleStack")

app.synth()
```

### Known limits

- `aws_cdk.aws_s3_assets.Asset` supports up to 2GB/asset (limited by NodeJS implementation).
- S3 bucket supports up to 5TB objects.

### Testing

No throughout testing is yet implemented - only a single integration test, checking the success of `cdk synth` command.
