# image-knocker

Knock your images before these make you painful.

# Background

One day, I had runned my deep learning model training program and got off work at Friday.

When I checked the trainning process at Monday after arriving at work, the program was terminated because of some images that cannot be opened by image processing libraries like PIL.

I developed this project to check images that cannot be opened by image processing libraries before running computer vision applications.

`image-knocker` is very fast!

```
pip install image-knocker
```

# Usage

```console
foo@bar:~$ image-knocker --path dataset_path/ --exts png jpg jpeg
