    """
    The noise-median method for baseline identification.

    Assumes the baseline can be considered as the median value within a moving
    window, and the resulting baseline is then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    half_window : int
        The index-based size to use for the median window. The total window
        size will range from [-half_window, ..., half_window] with size
        2 * half_window + 1.
    smooth_half_window : int, optional
        The half window to use for smoothing. Default is None, which will use
        the same value as `half_window`.
    sigma : float, optional
        The standard deviation of the smoothing Gaussian kernel. Default is None,
        which will use (2 * `smooth_half_window` + 1) / 6.
    **pad_kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
        the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from convolution.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated and smoothed baseline.
    dict
        An empty dictionary, just to match the output of all other algorithms.

    """
    Statistics-sensitive Non-linear Iterative Peak-clipping (SNIP).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    max_half_window : int or Sequence(int, int)
        The maximum number of iterations. Should be set such that
        `max_half_window` is approxiamtely ``(w-1)/2``, where ``w`` is the index-based
        width of a feature or peak. `max_half_window` can also be a sequence of
        two integers for asymmetric peaks, with the first item corresponding to
        the `max_half_window` of the peak's left edge, and the second item
        for the peak's right edge [3]_.
    decreasing : bool, optional
        If False (default), will iterate through window sizes from 1 to
        `max_half_window`. If True, will reverse the order and iterate from
        `max_half_window` to 1, which gives a smoother baseline according to [3]_
        and [4]_.
    smooth_half_window : int, optional
        The half window to use for smoothing the data. If `smooth_half_window`
        is greater than 0, will perform a moving average smooth on the data for
        each window, which gives better results for noisy data [3]_. Default is
        None, which will not perform any smoothing.
    filter_order : {2, 4, 6, 8}, optional
        If the measured data has a more complicated baseline consisting of other
        elements such as Compton edges, then a higher `filter_order` should be
        selected [3]_. Default is 2, which works well for approximating a linear
        baseline.
    **pad_kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
        the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from convolution.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    dict
        An empty dictionary, just to match the output of all other algorithms.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if `filter_order` is not 2, 4, 6, or 8.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        Raised if max_half_window is greater than (len(data) - 1) // 2.

    Notes
    -----
    Algorithm initially developed by [1]_, and this specific version of the
    algorithm is adapted from [2]_, [3]_, and [4]_.

    If data covers several orders of magnitude, better results can be obtained
    by first transforming the data using log-log-square transform before
    using SNIP [2]_::

        transformed_data =  np.log(np.log(np.sqrt(data + 1) + 1) + 1)

    and then baseline can then be reverted back to the original scale using inverse::

        baseline = -1 + (np.exp(np.exp(snip(transformed_data)) - 1) - 1)**2

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : numpy.ndarray, shape (N + 2 * max_half_window,)
        The array of the measured data with N data points padded at each edge with
        `max_half_window` extra data points.
    vander : numpy.ndarray, shape (N - 1, 4)
        The Vandermonde matrix for computing the 3rd order polynomial fit of the
        differential of the residual. Used for the alternate exit criteria.
    pseudo_inverse : numpy.ndarray, shape (4, N - 1)
        The pseudo-inverse of the Vandermonde matrix for computing the 3rd order
        polynomial fit of the differential of the residual. Used for the alternate
        exit criteria.
    data_slice : slice
        The slice used for separating the actual values of `y` from the extended y
        array.
    max_half_window : int
        The maximum allowable half window.
    min_half_window : int, optional
        The minimum half window that must be reached before exit criteria are
        considered. Default is 3.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N + 2 * max_half_window,)
        The baseline with the padded edges.
    converged : bool or None
        Whether the main exit criteria was achieved. True if it was, False
        if the alternate exit criteria was achieved, and None if `max_half_window`
        was reached before either exit criteria.
    half_window : int
        The half window at which the exit criteria was reached.

    Notes
    -----
    Uses a moving average rather than a 0-degree Savitzky–Golay filter since
    they are equivalent and the moving average is faster.

    The second exit criteria is based on Figure 2 in the reference, since the
    slightly different definition of criteria two stated in the text was always
    reached before the main exit criteria, which is not the desired outcome.

    dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

            A list of the half windows at which the exit criteria was reached.
            Has a length of 1 if the main exit criteria was intially reached,
            otherwise has a length of 2.
        * 'converged': list(bool or None)
            A list of the convergence status. Has a length of 1 if the main
            exit criteria was intially reached, otherwise has a length of 2.
            Each convergence status is True if the main exit criteria was
            reached, False if the second exit criteria was reached, and None
            if `max_half_window` is reached before either exit criteria.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm requires the input data to be fairly smooth (noise-free), so it
    is recommended to either smooth the data beforehand, or specify a
    `smooth_half_window` value. Non-smooth data can cause the exit criteria to be
    reached prematurely (can be avoided by setting a larger `min_half_window`), while
    over-smoothed data can cause the exit criteria to be reached later than optimal.

    The half-window at which convergence occurs is roughly close to the index-based
    full-width-at-half-maximum of a peak or feature, but can vary. Therfore, it is
    better to set a `min_half_window` that is smaller than expected to not miss the
    exit criteria.

    If the main exit criteria is not reached on the initial fit, a gaussian baseline
    (which is well handled by this algorithm) is added to the data, and it is re-fit.
