# French dictionary of Wordscapes solutions

## DESCRIPTION
This package contains a French dictionary of [Wordscapes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peoplefun.wordcross) solutions.

It's meant to be used as a complement to a real French dictionary such as [dict-fr-AU-DELA](https://github.com/HubTou/dict-fr-AU-DELA),
as the game uses non French words, first names and even stranger things...

However a real french dictionary will also give you additional points with recognized words not appearing on the grid.

## FILES
The dictionary *dict-fr-Wordscapes* is installed in Python's */usr/local* equivalent, under *share/dict*.

## SEE ALSO

## HISTORY
This dictionary was made for the [PNU project](https://github.com/HubTou/PNU)'s
[anagram(6)](https://github.com/HubTou/anagram/blob/main/README.md) command
in order to help my wife play
[Wordscapes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peoplefun.wordcross)
when she was stuck on a level.

## LICENSE
This dictionary is placed in the Public Domain.
