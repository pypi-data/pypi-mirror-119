How it works

+ Workflow of MarkerMAG

+ GC Bias Correction
  
    The GC content bias is calculated as follows.

MarkerMAG modules
---

1. Main module

    + `link`: linking MAGs with 16S rRNA marker genes
    
1. Supplementary modules

    + `rename_reads`: rename paired reads ([manual](doc/README_rename_reads.md))
    + `matam_16s`: assemble 16S rRNA genes with Matam, including reads subsample and the dereplication of produced 16S rRNA genes ([manual](doc/README_matam_16s.md))
    + `barrnap_16s`: identify 16S rRNA gene sequences from MAGs with Barrnap ([manual](doc/README_barrnap_16s.md))
    + `uclust_16s`: cluster 16S rRNA genes with Usearch ([manual](doc/README_uclust_16s.md))
    + `subsample_reads`: subsample reads with Usearch ([manual](doc/README_subsample_reads.md))


Dependencies
---
 
+ Dependencies for the `link` module: 
  [BLAST+](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download), 
  [Barrnap](https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap), 
  [seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk), 
  [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml), 
  [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org), 
  [metaSPAdes](https://cab.spbu.ru/software/meta-spades/)

+ You need to either add the dependencies to your system path or specify the path to their executable files with the corresponding arguments.
  
+ Dependencies for supplementary modules can be found from their own manual page.
 

How to install
---

+ BioSAK has been tested on Linux/Mac, but NOT on Windows.
+ MarkerMAG is implemented in [python3](https://www.python.org), you can install it with pip3:

      # install with 
      pip3 install MarkerMAG
        
      # upgrade with 
      pip3 install --upgrade MarkerMAG

+ :warning: If you clone the repository directly off GitHub you might end up with a version that is still under development.


How to run
---

+ :warning: MarkerMAG assumes the id of reads in pair in the format of `XXXX.1` and `XXXX.2`. The only difference is the last character.
   You can rename your reads with MarkerMAG's `rename_reads` module ([manual](doc/README_rename_reads.md)). 
 

+ Although you can use your preferred tool to reconstruct 16S rRNA gene sequences from the metagenomic dataset, 
   MarkerMAG does have a supplementary module (`matam_16s`) to reconstruct 16S rRNA genes. 
   Please refer to the manual [here](doc/README_matam_16s.md) if you want to give it a go.

+ Link 16S rRNA gene sequences with MAGs: 

      MarkerMAG link -p Soil -marker Soil_16S.fa -mag Soil_MAGs -x fa -r1 R1.fa -r2 R2.fa -t 12

+ A detailed explanation for all customizable parameters needs to be added.

1. Summary of identified linkages at genome level:

    | Marker | MAG | Linkage | Round |
    |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
    | matam_16S_7   | MAG_6 | 181| Rd1 |
    | matam_16S_12  | MAG_9 | 102| Rd1 |
    | matam_16S_6   | MAG_59| 55 | Rd2 |

1. Summary of identified linkages at contig level:

    |Marker___MAG(total number of linkages)	|Contig	        |Round_1	|Round_2	|
    |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
    |matam_16S_7___MAG_6(181)	            |Contig_1799	|176	    |0          |

   as well as its visualization:
   
   ![linkages](doc/images/linkages_plot.png)

1. Visualization of individual linkage
  
   MarkerMAG supports the visualization of all identified linkages (requires [Tablet](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/tablet/)). 
   Files for visualization ([example](doc/vis_folder)) can be found in the [Prefix]_linkage_visualization_rd1/2 folders. 
   You can visualize how the linking reads are aligned to the linked MAG contig and 16S rRNA gene by double-clicking the .tablet file. 
   Fifty Ns are added between the linked MAG contig and 16S rRNA gene.

   *If you see an error from Tablet that says "input files are not in a format that can be understood by tablet", 
   please refer to [https://github.com/cropgeeks/tablet/issues/15](https://github.com/cropgeeks/tablet/issues/15) for one potential solution.
