    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function

    Given function f(x) and arguments a, ..., k;

    Nearly equivalent to list(map(f, a, ..., k))

    ..note: tqdm is optional but highly recommended.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function
        The function to call
    *args : list-like
        Arguments to pass as f(*args), as a, ..., k
    **kwargs : dict

    Returns
    -------
    res : list
        The results from f(*args)

    Examples
    --------
    Provides a clean way to do a list comprehension:
    >>> from gitermap import umap
    >>> umap(lambda x: x**2, [2, 4, 6])
    >>> [4, 16, 36]
    Like the normal mapping, multiple lists map to
    multiple parameters passed to the function:
    >>> umap(lambda x, y: x + y, [2, 4, 6], [1, 2, 4])
    >>> [3, 6, 10]
    For functions that require additional keyword arguments 
    that are fixed across all iterations,
    `partial` can be used to the function as a precursor:
    >>> from functools import partial
    >>> def my_func(x, y, special):
    >>>		return (x + y) * special
    >>> updated_func = partial(my_func, special=1.5)
    >>> umap(updated_func, [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])
