# Line Profile Analysis - X-Ray Diffraction

This project is related to the analysis of crystals containing dislocations by X-ray diffraction. It was developed and used for a study conducted during a research internship at the laboratory of material and structural sciences of the *École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne*. This repository contains the distribution of one of the three published python packages that have been proposed to conduct line profile analyses based on simulation results:
* [`lpa-input`](https://github.com/DunstanBecht/lpa-input) (line profile analysis input generator)
* [`lpa-xrd`](https://github.com/DunstanBecht/lpa-xrd) (line profile analysis x-ray diffraction simulation program)
* [`lpa-output`](https://github.com/DunstanBecht/lpa-output) (line profile analysis output analyzer)

The repository [`lpa-workspace`](https://github.com/DunstanBecht/lpa-workspace) contains the parameters and the scripts for the generation of the data used in the study. You can then easily replicate the results obtained or use it as inspiration to take the code in hand and conduct your own calculations. The software is placed in the public domain and you can use it as you wish. However, users are encouraged to contribute to the development and report issues.

# Features

The package `lpa.xrd` can be used to:
* automate X-ray diffraction simulations

# Installation

The package is indexed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lpa-xrd/) and installable directly via pip:
```bash
pip install -U lpa-xrd
```

# User guide

The directory `tests/` contains several examples of package module usage. The docstrings are carefully written and it is recommended to refer to the documentation with the `help()` command.
