Description: # plover-clr-trans-state
        Adds a Plover command that clears the translation state (useful when switching applications).
        
        ## Usage
        Add `{plover:clear_trans_state}` as the translation for a chord (recommendation: `KHR-R`).
        
        Chording `KHR-R` will reset the translation state to as if Plover had just started up.
