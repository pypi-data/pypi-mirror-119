 Python Connector for Invinio-RDM Data Repository
**************************************************


Overview and Project State
==========================

This project is currently in "dormant" development, and not (yet)
fit for any production use. Initial purpose of this project was
to collect points at university; Currently this project is
awaiting to be bestowed with a new purpose -- Feel free to contact
me with regards to a future roadmap.

All APIs are subject to change.


How To Build
============

Distribution
------------

::

    pipenv sync
    pipenv run make dist

This will place a distributable package into the ``dist/`` directory.
This package can further be published or installed with ``pip3``.

Documentation
-------------

::

    pipenv sync
    pipenv run make docs

The documentation is then found in directory ``build/docs/``


Notes for Development
=====================

Some parts of the source and documentation are auto-generated from other
source files.

::

    pipenv sync
    pipenv run make generate

This will renew all generated source files after some changes have been
applied by a developer.


In-Source Nomenclature
======================

TODO
    points at which there could be further development in order to
    improve the performance, support more features, or increase
    resilience.

FIXME
    the issue discribed by that line MUST be fixed before this project
    could be considered for submitting as Exercise 2 Topic 9 solution.
