Some individual parts have different copyright notices as follows:

  docs/_static/swagger-ui/
    All files in this directory, except 'swagger-ui.html', are a re-
    distribution of the 'dist/' directory of the swagger-ui-3.51.0' project.
    The Apache-2.0 license as laid out in file docs/_static/swagger-ui/LICENSE
    applies.

  docs/_static/swagger-ui/swagger-ui.html
    This file content is mainly the json format version of the file
    'openapi/invenio.yaml'.

  docs/_static/openapi-*/
    The content of these directories are auto-generated from file
    'openapi/invenio.yaml' with the openapi-generator-cli.jar program
    distributed by the OpenApi Generator project.
    While the generator program itself is not included in this repository,
    the output is based on a template included in in that generator,
    which itself again includes parts from other projects.
    As such, the exakt license status of the content of these
    directories is unclear to this author.
    However, using the program and subsequently publishing the output
    for public viewing is in any case unprohibited.

  openapi/invenio.yaml
    This is the OpenApi 3.0.3 "translation" of the Invenio RDM Rest Api
    documentation. As such, the license of the original has to be
    considered. See inside this file at the top for details.

For all other parts as well for the project as a whole, this file lays
