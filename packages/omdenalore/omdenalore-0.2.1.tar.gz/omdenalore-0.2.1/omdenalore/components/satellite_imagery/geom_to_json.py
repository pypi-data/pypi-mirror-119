""" geom_to_json.py
	Converts a geometry, whether a shapefile or something else, into a JSON
	construct.  This format is required by Google Earth Engine (GEE) for further
	operation such as extracting a raster from satellite images.
	https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/table_upload

	This is a commen method of extracting datasets because it covers a certain
	range of time rather than a single event. The geometry bounds this collection
	to create a final raster that only contains attributes for the area of intereset
	(AOI). Because it uses GEE, the type has to be converted to JSON.

	NOTE ABOUT Google Earth Engine:
	This code assumes the user has the authorization and authentication to use GEE.
