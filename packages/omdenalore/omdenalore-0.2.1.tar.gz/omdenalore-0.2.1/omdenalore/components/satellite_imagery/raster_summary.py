""" raster_summary.py
	Provides a summary of the raster metadata and plot the image.
	User ensures the raster file path is known and pass into this function.
	Note the naming scheme, '.tif' is the common type when raster is originally created.

	https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/reading.html

	This function opens the file for reading then calls the close() method to end
	the process.  If this function gets called many times, this could slow down
	the process.  Remove the close() at the end or redesign the code to avoid
	process slowdown.

	Libraries:
		OS
		Pprint
		Rasterio

	API Calls:
		os.path.join()
		rasterio.open()
		pprint()
		show()

        External Dependency:
		None
