npfc: Natural Product Fragment Combinations
===========================================

**npfc** is a chemoinformatics tool for classifying Natural Product (NP) fragment
combinations into predefined categories and therefore identifying pseudo-NPs.

Pseudo-NPs are novel NP-inspired compound classes that combine the biological
relevance of NPs with the efficient exploration of chemical space by
fragment-based drug design.

The npfc tool is written in Python and based on several key packages:

- `RDKit`_ for handling chemistry
- `pandas`_ for managing data into DataFrames
- `NetworkX`_ for modelling graphs
- `Snakemake_` for encapsuling scripts into reproducible workflows

Installation
============

The npfc tool can be installed using PyPi. In your Python environment, run:

>>> pip install npfc
>>> conda install pytables

Documentation
=============

The full documentation is available at: https://github.com/jose-manuel/npfc.
It describes the API, as well as the different workflows implemented.

Contribution
============

Feedback from the community is warmly welcomed. It can be in the form of bug
reports and feature requests submitted via github or code contribution via
