A flexible concurrent command runner,
inspired by [Concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) and powered by [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich).


## Platform Support

Brood currently supports POSIX systems like Linux and MacOS.
You can try to run it on Windows, but it probably won't work!
