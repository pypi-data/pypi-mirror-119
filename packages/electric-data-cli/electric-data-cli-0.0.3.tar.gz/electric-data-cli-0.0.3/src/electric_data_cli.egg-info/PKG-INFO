Electric Data CLI
=================

The Electric Data CLI is the command line interface utility for the
`Electric Data <https://electricdata.net>`__ geo-distributed database
hosting service. It’s developed in Python and the code is published
under the `MIT
License <https://github.com/electric-data/electric-cli/blob/master/LICENSE>`__
at
`github.com/electric-data/electric-cli <https://github.com/electric-data/electric-cli>`__.

Develop
-------

You can install the CLI for local development by installing the
dependencies into a Python3 environment and developing the egg:

.. code:: sh

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python setup.py develop

This will install a ``electric`` binary in your local Python
environment’s bin folder. You can check that this is on your path with
e.g.:

.. code:: sh

   which electric

Build
-----

If you want to build standalone binaries, you first need to install the
extra development requirements:

.. code:: sh

   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Then you can build a `Pex <https://pex.readthedocs.io>`__ executable
using:

.. code:: sh

   python setup.py bdist_pex --bdist-all

This will create a ``./dist/electric`` binary which you can copy and run
anywhere on your system.

Alternatively, you can build a standalone binary with an embedded Python
interpretor using `PyOxidizer <https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io>`__:

.. code:: sh

   pyoxidizer run

This will create a binary at ``./build/:target/debug/install/electric``
that you can run on any machine with the same architecture and OS as
your build machine.

Usage
-----

Run the ``electric`` command without arguments or with the ``--help``
flag for usage information:

.. code:: sh

   electric --help

You can drill down into usage information for the resources / command
groups and for individual commands, e.g.:

.. code:: sh

   electric auth --help
   electric auth login --help

Further `documentation is available on the Electric Data
website <https://electricdata.net/docs>`__.

Test
----

Running the tests requires ``nose`` and ``coverage``, included in the
``dev-requirements.txt``.

Then, run e.g.:

.. code:: sh

   nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package electric
