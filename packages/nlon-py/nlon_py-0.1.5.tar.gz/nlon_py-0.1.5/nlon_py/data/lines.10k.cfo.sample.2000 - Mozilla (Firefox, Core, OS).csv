If we want to display a separate list of event listener sources in the debugger, we could either cache in the client and update on events 1 and 2 from comment 15, or keep a cache in the server and send notifications to the client. The low-level API lets us get notified when event listeners are triggered, not when they are added. To be fair, the only case not properly detected with our current hooks is adding an existing function as a listener, which was defined far away from the location of the registration (otherwise updating on the ""newSource"" packet will take care of that). Perhaps that's not too common to worry about in v1?"
