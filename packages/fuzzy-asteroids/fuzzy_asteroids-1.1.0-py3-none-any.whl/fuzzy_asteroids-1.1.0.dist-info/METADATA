# Fuzzy Asteroids

This repository is a dependency for the [2021 UC Fuzzy Challenge repository](https://github.com/TimArnettThales/UCFuzzyChallenge). 
in which it is used as the simulation environment for the development of Fuzzy Logic AIs by competitors.

## Dependencies

The Python Arcade Library is the primary dependency for this repo and is used for creating the environment
for the game.
