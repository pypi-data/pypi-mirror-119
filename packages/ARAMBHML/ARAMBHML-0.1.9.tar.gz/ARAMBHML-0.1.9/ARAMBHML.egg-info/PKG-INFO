        ## Functionality of the Auto ML Framework
        
        - Detects the type of problem from the given target feature
        - Does EDA on it's own
        - Finds out if there are null values present or not
        - If null values are present they are treated specifically with the class they are present in
        - Forms train-test split on it's own
        - Applies 6 ML models to show the use which model performs the best
        
        ## Usage
        
        - Make sure you have Python installed in your system.
        - Run Following command in the CMD.
         ```
          pip install ARAMBHML
          ```
        ## Example
        
         
        # test.py
         ```
          from ARAMBHML import arambhNet
          ```
         ```
          new = arambhNet(path,target) #target is the dependent feature and path is the path of csv file
          ```
         ```
          new.get_model_details(path,target)
          ```
        
        ## Run the Above Commands to get the results.
         
        
        **NOTE** There are more than functionalities available, you can press "tab" after "new." to get the options
        
        ## Here you can perform EDA and also see how do models perform on the dataset.
        
        ## Note 
        - I have tried to implement all the functionality, it might have some bugs also. Moreover a number of more functionalities would be added later.
