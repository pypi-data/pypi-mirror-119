## What is it?

**divina** is a Python package that provides scalable, interpretable and accurate forecasting capabilities designed to make causal forecasting modular, efficient and simple.
It aims to be reduce the challenge of causal forecasting on datasets of any size to experiment configuration via JSON and, if the extensive set of pre-implemented models is insufficient, custom ensemble design via scikit-learn.
More specifically, divina aims to raise the standard of functionality in forecasting by implementing two-way interpretability interfaces for all models.


## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

  - Easy construction of parquet-based [**datasets**][datasets] that allow for efficient, scalable modelling and dynamic, JSON-driven definition of multi-dataset experiments.
  - Abstraction of granular experiment configuration such as cross-validation, regularization and metric selection to a single, simple JSON-based configuration file with sensible defaults.  
  - Automatic persistence of all experiment artifacts, including models, predictions and validation metrics, to s3 for posterity, traceability and easy integration.
  - A user-centric, two-way [**interpretation interface**][interpretation] that allows for granular interpretation of models and predictions while also allowing domain experts to override factors.
