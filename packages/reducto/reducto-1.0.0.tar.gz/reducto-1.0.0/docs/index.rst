reducto - Python source code features in a command
==================================================

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   command_line_interface
   changelog

Quickstart
----------
Hands on example

Installation
------------

To install the package, use pip, preferably inside a virtual
environment.

.. code-block::

   $ pip install reducto

reducto requires version 3.8 at least.

Motivation
----------
I was watching for a toy project and remembered reading `The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python <https://docs.python-guide.org/>`_
by *Kenneth Reitz & Tanya Schlusser*. In the *Chapter 5: Reading Great Code*,
there is a table titled, Common features in the example projects. A copy
of the table can be seen here:

   :alt: reading_great_code_table5_1

I thought a package able to obtain those features and alike would be an
interesting project (at least for me at the moment), and here it is.

About the title
---------------
I'm a Harry Potter fan and the name can be cast as a spell.

Its a simple command line interface that reduces the content
of the python source code to a bunch of simple measures.

It must be a name which didn't exist on PyPI, so... reducto it is.
