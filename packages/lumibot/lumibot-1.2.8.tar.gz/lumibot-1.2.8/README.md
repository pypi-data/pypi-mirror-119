# Quickstart

Currently Alpaca and Interactive Brokers are available as a brokerage services. This 
quickstart is about using Alpaca services. After the quickstart will be instructions 
specific to Interactive Brokers.

1) Install the package on your computer
```shell
pip install lumibot
```
2) Create an alpaca paper trading account: https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview
3) Copy your API_KEY and API_SECRET from alpaca dashboard 
   and create a credentials.py file in the root directory of this project with the following class:
```python
class AlpacaConfig:
    API_KEY = "YOUR ALPACA API KEY"
    API_SECRET = "YOUR ALPACA API SECRET"
```
```API_KEY``` and ```API_SECRET``` are obtained from alpaca paper trading dashboard: https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview

4) Create your own strategy class (See strategy section) e.g. ```class MyStrategy(Startegy)```
or import an example from our libraries
   
```python
from lumibot.strategies.examples import Momentum
```

5) Create another file meant to be the entrypoint of your code e.g. main.py
6) import the following modules in your main.py:
```python
# importing the trader class
from lumibot.traders import Trader
# importing the alpaca broker class
from lumibot.brokers import Alpaca
# importing the credential class created in step 2
from credentials import AlpacaConfig
# importing the strategy class created in step 3
from lumibot.strategies.examples import Momentum
```
7) In your main.py, define variables for the budget allocated to your strategy. 
   Additionally, define the destination of the logfile.
```python
budget = 40000
logfile = "logs/test.log"
```
8) Instantiate the ```Trader``` class and the ```Alpaca``` class like so:
```python
trader = Trader(logfile=logfile)
broker = Alpaca(AlpacaConfig)
```
The ```Alpaca``` broker class needs your credentials created in step 3 to loging to your paper trading account.

9) Instantiate your strategy class like so:
```python
strategy = Momentum(name="momentum", budget=budget, broker=broker)
```
10) Register the strategy within the trader
```python
trader.add_strategy(strategy)
```
11) Run the trader
```python
trader.run_all()
```

Below an example of main.py:
```python
# main.py
from lumibot.traders import Trader
from lumibot.brokers import Alpaca
from lumibot.strategies.examples import Momentum
from credentials import AlpacaConfig

budget = 40000
logfile = "logs/test.log"

trader = Trader(logfile=logfile)
broker = Alpaca(AlpacaConfig)

strategy = Momentum(name="momentum", budget=budget, broker=broker)
trader.add_strategy(strategy)
trader.run_all()
```

# Interactive Brokers

To trade in your interactive brokers account, you must install Trader Workstation 
(or Gateway). Instructions for installation can be found [here](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/initial_setup.html).

Once installed, navigate in Trader Workstation to `File/Global Configuration/ then 
API/Settings` The key settings required to trade using Lumibot are: 
  - Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients
  - Disable Read-Only API
  - Socket port `7496` for live trading, `7497` for paper account trading. 
    > It is highly recommended to thoroughly test your algorithm in paper trading mode 
    before trading live.
  - Master API Client ID: You can find in the Trader Workstation by going to File -> Global Configurations -> API -> Settings, then looking for "Master API client ID". This can be any number you choose up to 999. You will use 
    this in your configuration file to log in.

Set up your `credentials.py` file as follows: 
    
    class InteractiveBrokersConfig:
        SOCKET_PORT = 7497 
        CLIENT_ID = "your Master API Client ID three digit number"
        IP = "127.0.0.1"

Set up your entry point file as above, except using Interactive Brokers. Here is an 
example of a completed file: 

```python
# main.py
from lumibot.traders import Trader
from lumibot.brokers import InteractiveBrokers
from lumibot.strategies.examples import Strangle 
from credentials import InteractiveBrokersConfig

budget = 40000
logfile = "logs/test.log"

trader = Trader(logfile=logfile)
interactive_brokers = InteractiveBrokers(InteractiveBrokersConfig)

strategy = Strangle(name="option", budget=budget, broker=interactive_brokers)
trader.add_strategy(strategy)
trader.run_all()
```

You can also see the file `simple_start_ib.py` for a working bot

# Backtesting

You can also run backtests very easily on your strategies, you do not have to 
modify anything in your strategies. (Intraday and options backtests are not available at this time.)
Simply call the `backtest()` function on your strategy class. You will also have the 
details of your backtest (the portfolio value each day, unspent money, etc) 
put into a CSV file in the location of `stats_file`.

```python
from lumibot.backtesting import YahooDataBacktesting
from my_strategy import MyStrategy

from datetime import datetime

# Pick the dates that you want to start and end your backtest
# and the allocated budget
backtesting_start = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
backtesting_end = datetime(2020, 12, 31)
budget = 100000

# Run the backtest
stats_file = "logs/my_strategy_backtest.csv"
plot_file = f"logs/my_strategy_backtest.jpg"
MyStrategy.backtest(
    "my_strategy",
    budget,
    YahooDataBacktesting,
    backtesting_start,
    backtesting_end,
    stats_file=stats_file,
    plot_file=plot_file,
    benchmark_asset="SPY",
)
```

## Example Strategies

Lumibot provides a set of several example strategies that you can copy from to create 
your own, they are located in `lumibot->strategies->examples`. Here is a breakdown of each example strategy:

#### Diversification
Allocates the budget by the percent allocations set in self.portfolio and rebalances every self.
period days. For example, if there is a budget of $100,000 then the strategy will buy $30,000 SPY, 
$40,000 TLT, etc. at current default weights in the strategy. The strategy will then buy/sell 
assets every day depending on self.portfolio_value (the amount of money available in this 
strategy) so that the target percentages laid out in self.portfolio are achieved.

#### Intraday Momentum
Buys the best performing asset from self.symbols over self.momentum_length number of minutes.
For example, if TSLA increased 0.03% in the past two minutes, but SPY, GLD, TLT and MSFT only 
increased 0.01% in the past two minutes, then the strategy will buy TSLA.

#### Momentum
Buys the best performing asset from self.symbols over self.period number of days.
For example, if SPY increased 2% yesterday, but VEU and AGG only increased 1% yesterday,
then the strategy will buy SPY.

#### Simple
Buys and sells 10 of self.buy_symbol every day (not meant to make money, just an example).
For example, Day 1 it will buy 10 shares, Day 2 it will sell all of them, Day 3 it will 
buy 10 shares again, etc.

#### Strangle
An options strategy trading through Interactive Brokers only. A simple strangle 
strategy where the bot simultaneously buys an out-of-the-money call and an 
out-of-the-money put option. The call option's strike price is higher than the 
underlying asset's current market price, while the put has a strike price that is 
lower than the asset's market price.

# Entities

## asset

An asset object represents securities such as stocks or options in Lumibot. Attributes 
that are tracked for assets are: 
  - symbol(str): Ticker symbol representing the stock or underlying for options. So for 
    example if trading IBM calls the symbol would just be `IBM`. 
  - asset_type(str): Asset type can be either `stock`, `option`, `future`, `forex`. default: `stock`
  - name(str): Optional to add in the name of the corporation for logging or printout.  
  #### Options only
  - expiration (str): Expiration of the options contract. Format is "YYYYMMDD".
  - strike(float): Contract strike price.
  - right(str): May enter `call` or `put`.
  - multiplier(float): Contract multiplier to the underlying. (default: 1)
  
  #### Futures Only
  Set up a futures contract using the following: 
  - symbol(str): Ticker symbol for the contract, > eg: `ES`
  - asset_type(str): "future"
  - expiration(str): Month formatted as `YYYYMM`. So August 2021 would be `202108`
  
  #### Forex Only
  - symbol(str): Currency base: eg: `EUR`
  - currency(str): Conversion currency. eg: `GBP`
  - asset_type(str): "forex"

When creating a new security there are two options. 
1. Security symbol: It is permissible to use the security symbol only when trading 
   stocks. Lumibot will convert the ticker symbol to an asset behind the scenes.
   
2. Asset object: Asset objects may be created at anytime for stocks or options. For 
   options, futures, or forex asset objects are mandatory due to the additional details required to 
   identify and trade these securities. 
   
Assets may be created using the `self.create_asset` method as follows: 
  `self.create_asset(symbol, asset_type=`option`, **kwargs)` 
    * see attributes above.
    
### Examples:

For stocks:

```python
asset = self.create_asset('SPY', asset_type="stock")
order = self.create_order(asset, 10, "buy")
self.submit_order(order)
```


For futures:

```python
asset = self.create_asset(
  'ES', asset_type="future", expiration="202111"
)
order = self.create_order(asset, 10, "buy")
self.submit_order(order)
```


## bars

This object is a wrapper around pandas dataframe and contains bars data. The raw pandas dataframe
object corresponds to ```bars.df```. The dataframe has the following columns
- open
- high
- low
- close
- volume
- dividend
- stock_splits

The dataframe index is of type ```pd.Timestamp``` localized at the timezone ```America/New_York```.   

Bars objects have the following fields:
- source: the source of the data e.g. (yahoo, alpaca, ...)
- symbol: the symbol of the bars
- df: the pandas dataframe containing all the datas

Bars objects has the following helper methods:
- ```get_last_price()```: Returns the closing price of the last dataframe row
- ```get_last_dividend()```: Returns the dividend per share value of the last dataframe row
- ```get_momentum(start=None, end=None)```: Calculates the global price momentum of the dataframe.
- ```aggregate_bars(frequency)```: Will convert a set of bars to a different timeframe (eg. 1 min to 15 min) frequency (string): The new timeframe that the bars should be in, eg. "15Min", "1H", or "1D". Returns a new Bars object.

When specified, start and end will be used to filter the daterange for the momentum calculation.
  If none of ``start`` or ``end`` are specified the momentum will be calculated from the first row untill
  the last row of the dataframe.
- ```get_total_volume(start=None, end=None)```: returns the sum of the volume column. 
  When ```start``` and/or ```end``` is/are specified use them to filter for that given daterange
  before returning the total volume
- ```filter(start=None, end=None)```: Filter the bars dataframe.
  When ```start``` and/or ```end``` is/are specified use them to filter for that given daterange
  before returning the total volume

When getting historical data from Interactive Brokers, it is important to note that they do not
consider themselves a data supplier. If you exceed these data access pacing rates, your data
will be throttled. Additionally, with respect to above three mentioned helpers, when using 
Interactive Brokers live, tick data is called instead of bar data. This allows for more frequent 
and accurate pricing updates. `get_last_dividend` are not available in Interactive Brokers. (see 
[Interactive Brokers' pacing rules](https://interactivebrokers.github.
io/tws-api/historical_limitations.html))

## order

This object represents an order. Each order belongs to a specific strategy. 

A simple market order can be constructed as follows:

```python
symbol = "SPY"
quantity = 50
side = "buy"
order = self.create_order(symbol, quantity, side)
```

With:
- symbol (str): the string representation of the asset e.g. "GOOG" for Google
- quantity (int): the number of shares to buy/sell
- side (str): must be either ```"buy"``` for buying order or ```"sell"``` for selling order

Order objects have the following helper methods
- ```to_position()```: convert an order to a position belonging to the same strategy with 
```order.quantity``` amount of shares.
- ```get_increment()```: for selling orders returns ```- order.quantity```, for buying orders returns ```order.quantity```
- ```wait_to_be_registered```: wait for the order to be registered by the broker
- ```wait_to_be_closed```: wait for the order to be closed by the broker (Order either filled or closed)

### advanced order types

#### limit order

A limit order is an order to buy or sell at a specified price or better.

To create a limit order object, add the keyword parameter `limit_price`

```python
my_limit_price = 500
order = self.create_order(symbol, quantity, side, limit_price=my_limit_price)
self.submit_order(order)
```

#### stop order

A stop (market) order is an order to buy or sell a security when its price moves past a particular point, ensuring a higher probability of achieving a predetermined entry or exit price.

To create a stop order object, add the keyword parameter `stop_price`.

```python
my_stop_price = 400
order = self.create_order(symbol, quantity, side, stop_price=my_stop_price)
self.submit_order(order)
```

#### stop_limit order

A stop_limit order is a stop order with a limit price (combining stop orders and limit orders)  

To create a stop_limit order object, add the keyword parameters `stop_price` and `limit_price`.

```python
my_limit_price = 405
my_stop_price = 400
order = self.create_order(symbol, quantity, side, stop_price=my_stop_price,               limit_price=my_limit_price)
self.submit_order(order)
```

#### trailing_stop order

Trailing stop orders allow you to continuously and automatically keep updating the stop price threshold 
based on the stock price movement.

To create trailing_stop orders, add either a `trail_price` or a `trail_percent` keyword parameter.

```python
my_trail_price = 20
order_1 = self.create_order(symbol, quantity, side, trail_price=my_trail_price)
self.submit_order(order_1)

my_trail_percent = 2.0 # 2.0 % 
order_2 = self.create_order(symbol, quantity, side, trail_percent=my_trail_percent)
self.submit_order(order_2)
```

> *** NOTE: Advanced type of orders work as normal in live trading, but will be ignored in 
backtesting. Meaning that a backtest will assume limit and stop orders were never executed.

### order with legs

#### bracket order

A bracket order is a chain of three orders that can be used to manage your position entry and exit.

The first order is used to enter a new long or short position, and once it is completely filled, 
two conditional exit orders will be activated. One of the two closing orders is called a 
take-profit order, which is a limit order, and the other closing order is a stop-loss order, 
which is either a stop or stop-limit order. 
Importantly, only one of the two exit orders can be executed. Once one of the exit orders fills, 
the other order cancels. Please note, however, that in extremely volatile and fast market 
conditions, both orders may fill before the cancellation occurs.

To create a bracket order object, add the keyword parameters `take_profit_price` and `stop_loss_price`.
A `stop_loss_limit_price` can also be specified to make the stop loss order a stop-limit order.

```python
my_take_profit_price = 420
my_stop_loss_price = 400
order = self.create_order(
  symbol, quantity, side, 
  take_profit_price=my_take_profit_price,
  stop_loss_price=my_stop_loss_price
)
self.submit_order(order)
```
> Interactive Brokers requires the main or parent order to be a limit order. Add  
> `limit_price=my_limit_price`. 

#### OTO (One-Triggers-Other) order 

OTO (One-Triggers-Other) is a variant of bracket order. 
It takes one of the take-profit or stop-loss order in addition to the entry order.

To create an OTO order object, add either a `take_profit_price` or a `stop_loss_price` keyword parameter.
A `stop_loss_limit_price` can also be specified in case of stop loss exit.

> Interactive Brokers requires the main or parent order to be a limit order. Add 
> `limit_price=my_limit_price`. 

#### OCO (One-Cancels-Other) order

OCO orders are a set of two orders with the same side (buy/buy or sell/sell).
In other words, this is the second part of the bracket orders where the entry order is already filled, 
and you can submit the take-profit and stop-loss in one order submission.

To create an OCO order object, add the keyword parameters `take_profit_price` and `stop_loss_price`
and set `position_filled` to `True`. 
A `stop_loss_limit_price` can also be specified to make the stop loss order a stop-limit order.

```python
my_take_profit_price = 420
my_stop_loss_price = 400
order = self.create_order(
  symbol, quantity, side, 
  take_profit_price=my_take_profit_price,
  stop_loss_price=my_stop_loss_price,
  position_filled=True
)
self.submit_order(order)
```
> Interactive Brokers requires the main or parent order to be a limit order. Add `limit_price=my_limit_price`. 

*** NOTE: Orders with legs work as normal in live trading, but will be ignored in backtesting. Meaning that a backtest will never execute the order legs.

## position

This object represents a position. Each position belongs to a specific strategy.
Position object has the following properties
- strategy (str): the strategy name that this order belongs to
- symbol (str): the string representation of the asset e.g. "GOOG" for Google
- quantity (int): the number of shares held
- orders (list(order)): a list of orders objects responsible for the current state of the position

Position objects have also the following helper methods
- ```get_selling_order()```: returns an order for selling all the shares attached to this position.

# Strategies

## Strategy

All user defined strategies should inherit from the Strategy class.
```python
from strategies import Strategy

class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    pass
```

The abstract class ```Strategy``` has global parameters with default values, and some 
properties that can be used as helpers to build trading logic.

The methods of this class can be split into several categories:

**Lifecycle Methods** These are executed at different times during the execution of the bot. These represent the main flow of a strategy, some are mandatory.

**Strategy Methods** These are strategy helper methods.

**Broker Methods** How to interact with the broker (buy, sell, get positions, etc)

**Data Methods** How to get price data easily

All the methods in each of these categories are described below.

## Lifecycle Methods

The abstract class Strategy defines a design pattern that needs to be followed by user-defined 
strategies. The design pattern was greatly influenced by React.js components and their lifecycle 
methods.

When building strategies, lifecycle methods needs to be overloaded.
Trading logics should be implemented in these methods.

![lifecycle methods](lifecycle_methods.png)

#### initialize

This lifecycle methods is executed only once, when the strategy execution starts.
Use this lifecycle method to initialize parameters like:
- ```self.sleeptime```: the sleeptime duration between each trading iteration in minutes
- ```self.minutes_before_closing```: number of minutes before the market closes to stop trading

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def initialize(self, my_custom_parameter=True):
        self.sleeptime = 5
        self.minutes_before_closing = 15
        self.my_custom_parameter = my_custom_parameter
```

##### Custom Parameters

You can also use the initialize method to define custom parameters 
like ```my_custom_parameter``` in the example above. You can name these parameters however you'd like, and add as many as you'd like.

These parameters can easily be set using the strategy constructor later on.

```python
strategy_1 = MyStrategy(
  name="strategy_1",
  budget=budget,
  broker=broker,
  my_custom_parameter=False,
  my_other_parameter=50
)

strategy_2 = MyStrategy(
  name="strategy_2",
  budget=budget,
  broker=broker,
  my_custom_parameter=True,
  my_last_parameter="SPY"
)
```

or just for backtesting

```python
options = [True, False]
for option in options:
    MyStrategy.backtest(
        "my_strategy",
        budget,
        YahooDataBacktesting,
        backtesting_start,
        backtesting_end,
        stats_file=stats_file,
        my_custom_parameter=option,
        my_last_parameter="SPY"
    )
# `options` in this example is not referring to trading options contracts.
```

##### Changing Market Hours

If you'd like to change the market hours for which the bot operates, then you can use the `set_market()` function like this:
```python
def initialize(self, asset_symbol="MNQ", expiration="202109"):
    self.set_market('24/7')
```
Default is `NASDAQ` days and hours.

Possible calendars include:
```python
['MarketCalendar', 'ASX', 'BMF', 'CFE', 'NYSE', 'stock', 'NASDAQ', 'BATS', 'CME_Equity', 'CBOT_Equity', 'CME_Agriculture', 'CBOT_Agriculture', 'COMEX_Agriculture', 'NYMEX_Agriculture', 'CME_Rate', 'CBOT_Rate', 'CME_InterestRate', 'CBOT_InterestRate', 'CME_Bond', 'CBOT_Bond', 'EUREX', 'HKEX', 'ICE', 'ICEUS', 'NYFE', 'JPX', 'LSE', 'OSE', 'SIX', 'SSE', 'TSX', 'TSXV', 'BSE', 'TASE', 'TradingCalendar', 'ASEX', 'BVMF', 'CMES', 'IEPA', 'XAMS', 'XASX', 'XBKK', 'XBOG', 'XBOM', 'XBRU', 'XBUD', 'XBUE', 'XCBF', 'XCSE', 'XDUB', 'XFRA', 'XETR', 'XHEL', 'XHKG', 'XICE', 'XIDX', 'XIST', 'XJSE', 'XKAR', 'XKLS', 'XKRX', 'XLIM', 'XLIS', 'XLON', 'XMAD', 'XMEX', 'XMIL', 'XMOS', 'XNYS', 'XNZE', 'XOSL', 'XPAR', 'XPHS', 'XPRA', 'XSES', 'XSGO', 'XSHG', 'XSTO', 'XSWX', 'XTAE', 'XTAI', 'XTKS', 'XTSE', 'XWAR', 'XWBO', 'us_futures', '24/7', '24/5']
```

#### before_market_opens

This lifecycle method is executed each day before market opens. 
If the strategy is first run when the market is already open, this method will be skipped the first day.
Use this lifecycle methods to execute business logic before starting trading like canceling all open orders.

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def before_market_opens(self):
        self.cancel_open_orders()
```

#### before_starting_trading

This lifecycle method is similar to before_market_opens.
However, unlike before_market_opens, this method will always be executed before starting 
trading even if the market is already open when the strategy was first launched.
After the first execution, both methods will be executed in the following order
1) before_market_opens
2) before_starting_trading.

Use this lifecycle method to reinitialize variables for day trading like resetting the list of
blacklisted shares.

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def before_starting_trading(self):
        self.blacklist = []
```

#### on_trading_iteration

This lifecycle method contains the main trading logic.
When the market opens, it will be executed in a loop.
After each iteration, the strategy will sleep for ```self.sleeptime``` minutes.
If no crash or interuption, the loop will be stopped
```self.minutes_before_closing``` minutes before market closes and will restart 
on the next day when market opens again.

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_trading_iteration(self):
        # pull data
        # check if should buy an asset based on data
        # if condition, buy/sell asset
        pass
```

#### before_market_closes

This lifecycle method is executed ```self.minutes_before_closing``` minutes before the market closes.
Use this lifecycle method to execute business logic like selling shares and closing open orders.

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def before_market_closes(self):
        self.sell_all()
```

#### after_market_closes

This lifecycle method is executed right after the market closes.

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def after_market_closes(self):
        pass
```

#### trace_stats

Lifecycle method that will be executed after on_trading_iteration. 
context is a dictionary containing the result of ```locals()``` of ```on_trading_iteration()```
at the end of its execution. 

```locals()``` returns a dictionary of the variables defined in the
scope where it is called.

Use this method to dump stats

```python
import random
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
   def on_trading_iteration(self):
       google_symbol = "GOOG"
  
   def trace_stats(self, context, snapshot_before):
       print(context)
       # printing
       # { "google_symbol":"GOOG"}
       random_number = random.randint(0, 100)
       row = {"my_custom_stat": random_number}

       return row
```

#### on_abrupt_closing

This lifecycle method runs when the strategy execution gets interrupted.
Use this lifecycle method to execute code to stop trading gracefully like selling all assets

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_abrupt_closing(self):
        self.sell_all()
```

#### on_bot_crash

This lifecycle method runs when the strategy crashes.
By default, if not overloaded,  it calls on_abrupt_closing.

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_bot_crash(self, error):
        self.on_abrupt_closing()
```

#### on_new_order

This lifecycle method runs when a new order has been successfully submitted to the broker.
Use this lifecycle event to execute code when the broker processes a new order.

Parameters:
- order (Order): The corresponding order object processed 

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_new_order(self, order):
        self.log_message("%r is currently being processed by the broker" % order)
```

#### on_canceled_order

The lifecycle method called when an order has been successfully canceled by the broker.
Use this lifecycle event to execute code when an order has been canceled by the broker

Parameters:
- order (Order): The corresponding order object that has been canceled

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_canceled_order(self, order):
        self.log_message("%r has been canceled by the broker" % order)
```

#### on_partially_filled_order

The lifecycle method called when an order has been partially filled by the broker.
Use this lifecycle event to execute code when an order has been partially filled by the broker.

Parameters:
- order (Order): The order object that is being processed by the broker
- price (float): The filled price
- quantity (int): The filled quantity
- multiplier (int): Options multiplier

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_partially_filled_order(self, order, price, quantity, multiplier):
        missing = order.quantity - quantity
        self.log_message(f"{quantity} has been filled")
        self.log_message(f"{quantity} waiting for the remaining {missing}")
```

#### on_filled_order

The lifecycle method called when an order has been successfully filled by the broker.
Use this lifecycle event to execute code when an order has been filled by the broker

Parameters:
- position (Position): The updated position object related to the order symbol. 
  If the strategy already holds 200 shares of SPY and 300 has just been filled, 
  then `position.quantity` will be 500 shares otherwise if it is a new
  position, a new position object will be created and passed to this method.
- order (Order): The corresponding order object that has been filled
- price (float): The filled price
- quantity (int): The filled quantity
- multiplier (int): Options multiplier

```python
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def on_filled_order(self, position, order, price, quantity, multiplier):
        if order.side == "sell":
            self.log_message(f"{quantity} shares of {order.symbol} has been sold at {price}$")
        elif order.side == "buy":
            self.log_message(f"{quantity} shares of {order.symbol} has been bought at {price}$")

        self.log_message(f"Currently holding {position.quantity} of {position.symbol}")
```

## Properties and Parameters

A strategy object has the following properties:

- name: indicates the name of the strategy.
- initial budget: indicates the initial budget
- minutes_before_closing. The lifecycle method on_trading_iteration is 
  executed inside a loop that stops only when there is only ```minutes_before_closing``` 
  minutes remaining before market closes. By default equals to 5 minutes.
  This value can be overloaded when creating a strategy class in order to change the 
  default behaviour. Another option is to specify it when creating an instance the strategy class
  ```python
  my_strategy = MyStrategy("my_strategy", budget, broker, minutes_before_closing=15)
  ```
- minutes_before_opening. The lifecycle method before_market_opens is executed ```minutes_before_opening```
  minutes before the market opens. By default equals to 60 minutes.
  This value can be overloaded when creating a strategy class in order to change the 
  default behaviour. Another option is to specify it when creating an instance the strategy class
  ```python
  my_strategy = MyStrategy("my_strategy", budget, broker, minutes_before_opening=15)
  ```
- sleeptime: Sleeptime in seconds or minutes after executing the lifecycle method 
  on_trading_iteration. By default equals 1 minute. You can set the sleep time as an integer 
  which will be interpreted as minutes. eg: sleeptime = 50 would be 50 minutes. Conversely, you 
  can enter the time as a string with the duration numbers first, followed by the time units: 
  'M' for minutes, 'S' for seconds eg: '300S' is 300 seconds, '10M' is 10 minutes. Only "S" and 
  "M" are allowed.
  
  This value can be overloaded when creating a strategy class in order to change the 
  default behaviour. Another option is to specify it when instantiating the strategy class
  ```python
  my_strategy = MyStrategy("my_strategy", budget, broker, sleeptime=2)
  ```
- parameters: a dictionary that contains keyword arguments passed to the constructor. 
  These keyords arguments will be passed to the `self.initialize()` lifecycle method
- is_backtesting: A boolean that indicates whether the strategy is run in live trading
  or in backtesting mode.
- portfolio_value: indicates the actual values of shares held by 
  the current strategy plus the total unspent money.
- unspent_money: indicates the amount of unspent money from the initial
  budget allocated to the strategy. This property is updated whenever a transaction was filled 
  by the broker or when dividends are paid.
- first_iteration: is `True` if the lifecycle method `on_trading_iteration` is being excuted for the first time.
- timezone: The string representation of the timezone used by the trading data_source. 
  By default ``America/New_York``.
- pytz: the ```pytz``` object representation of the timezone property.
