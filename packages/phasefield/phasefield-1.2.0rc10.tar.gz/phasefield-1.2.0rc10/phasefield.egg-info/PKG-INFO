Description: Automatic Construction of Phasefield Approximations from Sharp-Interface Models
        ===============================================================================
        
        The title says it all: this module uses a simple description of a sharp
        interface problem to derive a phasefield approximation which can then be
        solved using a finite-element toolbox. The domain specific language
        [UFL][ufllink] is used both for defining the sharp interface model and for
        the weak formulation of the phasefield approximation. The resulting UFL form
        can then be inserted into any of the finite element packages available
        which can take UFL forms as an input. A class for evolving the solution
        over time is available based on [dune][dunelink]  and [fenics][fenicslink].
        The bindings for the `dune` package are based on the dune module
        [dune-fem package][fempylink] include both dynamic local grid refinement
        and coarsening. This makes it easy to track the interface with a fine grid
        while a coarser grid can be used away from the interface. This is essential
        for evolving phasefield models efficiently. In addition the `dune` stepper
        also provides an efficient solver for obstacle problems so that double
        obstacle potentials can be used in the modelling. This solver is based
        on [tnmg][tnmglink].
        
        So far this module has been tested with:
        
        - two phase models including additional bulk equations, e.g., for the temperature
        - multphase models
        - single phase models, e.g., crack propagation problems
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The easiest way to test this module is to install the python package from
        the python package index:
        
        ```
        pip install phasefield
        ```
        
        Some example scripts showing how to use the package can then be optained by
        calling
        
        ```
        python -m phasefield
        ```
        
        The scripts are then located in the subfolder `phasefield_tutorial`.
        
        You can also clone the git repository
        ```
        git clone https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/agnumpde/dune-tnnmg
        ```
        and access the examples in the folder `phasefield/tutorial`.
        To get the python package up and running first execute
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        in the main folder of the repository.
