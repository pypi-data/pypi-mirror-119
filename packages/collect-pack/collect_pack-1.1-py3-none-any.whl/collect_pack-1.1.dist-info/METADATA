# result (3,['q','w','e'])
```

```
from collect_pack import format_return, amount_of_unique_char
print(format_return('qwerrr'))
# before format format the result it call amount_of_unique_char in his body 
""" result "qwerrr" => 3
q,w,e are present once.
"""
```

```
from collect_pack import work_with_args
print(work_with_args(file="",string="qwerr"))

print(work_with_args(file="text.txt",string="qwerr"))
# result 'text from file like one string ' argument file has a higher priority
```
