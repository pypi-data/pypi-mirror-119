    The returned instance is an iterable object. Each to next() with this instance will either
    return the instance if any tasks are still running, or raise StopIteration if all are complete.
    Therefore, instances of this class can be used as the right operand of `in` in for loops.

    A main application of this for-loop approach is to periodically run a code snippet (e.g., for logging)
    while the computation is performed in the background. The loop will continue until all tasks are completed.
    One can then call `ray.get(ray_id_list)` and retrieve the obtained results without any expected delay.

    blocking call to :meth:`ray.wait`.
