python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install from PyPI...
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -U ldict

# ...or, install from updated source code.
pip install git+https://github.com/davips/ldict
```

### from source

<p>

```python3
from ldict import ldict

a = ldict(x=3)
print(a)
"""
{
    "id": "kr_4aee5c3bcac2c478be9901d57fd1ef8a9d002",
    "ids": "kr_4aee5c3bcac2c478be9901d57fd1ef8a9d002",
    "x": 3
}
"""
```

```python3

b = ldict(y=5)
print(b)

    "y": 5
}
"""
```

```python3

## Concept
A ldict is like a common Python dict, with extra funtionality.
It is a mapping between string keys, called fields, and any serializable object.
The ldict `id` (identifier) and the field `ids` are also part of the mapping.  

The user can provide a unique identifier ([hosh](https://pypi.org/project/garoupa))
for each function or value object.
Otherwise, they will be calculated through blake3 hashing of the content of data or bytecode of function.
For this reason, such functions should be simple, i.e.,
with minimal external dependencies, to avoid the unfortunate situation where two
functions with identical local code actually perform different calculations through
calls to external code that implement different algorithms with the same name.
Alternatively, a Hosh object can be passed inside the dict that is returned by the function, under the key "_id".
