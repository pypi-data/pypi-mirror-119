# ldict
Uniquely identified lazy dict.

[Latest version as a package](https://pypi.org/project/ldict)

[Current code](https://github.com/davips/ldict)

## Overview
We consider that every data is generated by a process, starting from `empty`.
The process is a sequence of transformation steps that can be of two types:
value insertion and function application.
Value insertion is done using dict-like objects as shown below.
The operator `>>` concatenate the steps chronologically.

Function application is done in the same way.
The parameter names define the input fields,
while the keys in the returned dict define the output fields:

Similarly, for anonymous functions:

Finally, the result is only evaluated at request:

## Installation
### ...as a standalone lib
```bash
# Set up a virtualenv. 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install from PyPI...
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -U ldict

# ...or, install from updated source code.
pip install git+https://github.com/davips/ldict
```

### ...from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davips/ldict
cd ldict
poetry install
```

## Persistence
Extra dependencies can be installed to support saving data to disk or to a server in the network. 

**[still an ongoing work...]**

`poetry install -E full`

## Concept
A ldict is like a common Python dict, with extra funtionality and lazy.
It is a mapping between string keys, called fields, and any serializable object.
The ldict `id` (identifier) and the field `ids` are also part of the mapping.  

The user can provide a unique identifier ([hosh](https://pypi.org/project/garoupa))
for each function or value object.
Otherwise, they will be calculated through blake3 hashing of the content of data or bytecode of function.
For this reason, such functions should be simple, i.e.,
with minimal external dependencies, to avoid the unfortunate situation where two
functions with identical local code actually perform different calculations through
calls to external code that implement different algorithms with the same name.
Alternatively, a Hosh object can be passed inside the dict that is returned by the function, under the key "_id".
