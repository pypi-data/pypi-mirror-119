"""`pyrost`_ is a Python library for wavefront metrology and sample imaging
based on ptychographic speckle tracking algorithm. This project
takes over Andrew Morgan's `Ptychographic Speckle Tracking project`_
as an improved version aiming to add robustness to the optimisation
algorithm in the case of the high noise present in the measured data.
