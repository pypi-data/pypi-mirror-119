## How to Use in Google Colab?


[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SyUpFRWQrgriUnJcLGMatDvxxKP9TU5r?usp=sharing)

```
!pip install coolab # install package using pip
import coolab; coolab.Code().run() # run in seconds.
```

## How Fast is it

We cache vscode installation files and configurations in your google drive if you choose to mount your drive. It takes much less time if you run the same code at the second time (even in different colab sessions).

* VScode installation package is cached (so need to re-download vscode)
* Your connection token is cached (never worry about configuration)
* Working directory is cached (so you always automatically get directed back to the last working directory)

## How Coolab is Made

*Coolab* is made using *coolab* on Google *Colab* :laughing: (pun intended).

## Related Projects

A similar project [colabcode](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/colabcode) also provides vscode access using colab. However, we aim to provide better user experience using caching mechanism.

## Next Step

We aim to provide more online tools using the computation resource of Google Colab. You start to use these awesome tools and we deal with the rest!

## Suggestions

Feel free to create new [issue](https://github.com/songlinhou/coolab/issues) so we can improve this library!

## Updates

* Bug fixes to prevent crashing when selecting drives.
