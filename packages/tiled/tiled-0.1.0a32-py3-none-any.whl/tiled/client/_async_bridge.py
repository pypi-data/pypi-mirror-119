class AsyncClientBridge:
    """
    Run an httpx.AsyncClient on an event loop on its own thread.

    EXPERIMENTAL: This may be removed or change in a backward-incompatible way
    without notice.

    This exposes just the parts of the AsyncClient API that we need.
    Everything is exposed in a synchronous fashion.

    Motivation: Wrapping an ASGI app only works with an async client, by its
    construction. If we want a sync API, we need to bridge sync--async
    somewhere.
