Checking the status of the Multi-Planet Simulations
===================================================

To check the status of your simulations, type

.. code-block:: bash

    mpstatus <input file>

where the "input file" **must be the same file** used with :code:`vspace` and :code:`multi-planet`.
The following will be printed to the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    --Multi-Planet Status--
    Number of Simulations completed: 10
    Number of Simulations in progress: 5
    Number of Simulations remaining: 20

but with the proper statistics shown.
