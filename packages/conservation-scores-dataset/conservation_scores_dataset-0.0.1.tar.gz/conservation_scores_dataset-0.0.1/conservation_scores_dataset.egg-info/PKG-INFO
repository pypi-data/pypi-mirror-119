Description: Conservation scores dataset
        ===================================
        Pipeline to automatically retrieve and preprocess conservation scores
        
        Installing the package
        -----------------------------------
        As for any python package, simply run:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            pip install conservation_scores_dataset
        
        Usage examples
        ------------------------------------
        The following two usage examples will show both how to run the pipeline and how to retrieve the already pre-computed values stored within this GitHub repository.
        
        Running the pipeline to retrieve the data
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If you want to run the pipeline yourself, after taking note that some preprocessed data are already available within this repository, consider that the downloaded file will require a total size of ADDSIZE.
        
        After having installed the package, just run the following to retrieve all data relative to the FANTOM5 and ROADMAP datasets for enhancers and promoters:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from conservation_scores_dataset import retrieve_all
            retrieve_all()
        
        It will display some loading bars showing you what the pipeline is doing at a given time, such as the following ones:
        
        .. image:: https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/conservation_scores_dataset/blob/main/example_screenshot.png?raw=true
           :width: 400
        
        Based on the main loop provided in the retrieve all file, other similar automati retrieval pipelines for other BED files can be trivially built.
