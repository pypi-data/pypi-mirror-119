        ## Description
        A simple and light event countdown manager. Here, event is anything that you need countdown on. You can almost fill anything as event such as movie release dates or appointments.
        
        ## Features
        * Ability to run countdown of multiple events and printing of countdown is in different time format (GMT, Nepali, Indian)
        * Event creation is as easy as adding a few lines. It find the config files in different locations and even from argument
        * Output is colorful and oddly satisfying
        
        ## Installation
        Use either of any options:
        * `pip install event-timer`
        * `python3 setup.py install`
        
        ## Usage
        Before running this tool, create or edit config files which can be found in different locations. The order in which looks for config file is:
        1. --config filename.cfg
        2. {CURRENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY}/{DEFAULT_FILES}
        3. ~/{DEFAULT_FILES}
        4. EventTimer/{DEFAULT_FILES} if you use it without installation.  
        
        Here,
        * {DEFAULT_FILES}: `("event.cfg", ".event.cfg", "event_config.cfg", ".event_config.cfg")`. 
        * {CURRENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY}: The directory in which you are when running the program
        
        The default_file list may change and is found in src/EventTimer/lib/Globals.py
        
        Finally, `EventTimer` or `python3 EventTimer.py` to run.
        
        ## Examples
        See examples folder for event.cfg examples
        
        ## Limitations
        * Providing wrong data will cause wrong time to be displayed especially when choosing timezones. Some timezones maybe 1hr forward or backward so
        caution is advised on important events.
        * Unhidden logical bugs or faults in modules
        
        ## Todo
        * Send notification libnotifysend and slack notification when timer is reached.
