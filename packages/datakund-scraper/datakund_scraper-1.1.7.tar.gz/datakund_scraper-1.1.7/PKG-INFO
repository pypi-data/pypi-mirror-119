Description: DataKund Scraper is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from any url. You don't have to inspect any web elements to find tags, xpath id etc.
        It learns from the data given by you & builds a scraper. Then you can use it to get JSON data out of the HTML.
        
        ### Train Scraper
        We train scraper by passing url. This gives us id in return which can be used in future to run scraper. Training can take 2-3 minutes, but don't worry it is for first time only. Once trained you can pass any similiar link to that for fetching data.
        ```sh
        from datakund_scraper import *
        link='https://pypi.org/search/?q=firebase'
        response=scraper.train(url=link)
        #response={"id":"fwefsd45","status":True}
        ```
        
        
        ### Run Scraper
        We run scraper by passing url and id we fetched earlier in training. This gives us JSON data in return.
        ```sh
        from datakund_scraper import *
        link='https://pypi.org/search/?q=firebase'
        response=scraper.run(url=link,id="fwefsd45")
        #response={"Results":[{"title":"","link":""},...]}
        ```
