        Wisdom from Dave Rigby:
            For example, for radial equilibrium we must integrate across the span.  Some codes (GlennHT used to) would want a single block across the entire span.  In that case you would want some additional control.
 
            Another example might be if you would like a block to include the entire boundary layer.  In that case you might introduce an aspect ratio control.
