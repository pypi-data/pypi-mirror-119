Premark generates single-file HTML presentations from one or many markdown files, using [Remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark).
Based on [Remarker](https://github.com/tylerdave/remarker) by [@tylerdave](https://github.com/tylerdave).

## Notable Features

- Create slides from simple Markdown. Use three dashes on their own line (`---`) to indicate the transition from one slide to another. All other markdown features work as expected.

- The output is always a *single* HTML file. This means you can open it in your browser without spinning up a web server.
  - In contrast, with vanilla Remark, if your main HTML file needs to load any other files then it can't be opened locally without a web server.

- Your slides can be stored in multiple markdown files and Premark will automatically "stitch" them together into a single presentation, even creating title slides for each section if you want.

## Usage Example

Generate `presentation.html` from Markdown in `slides.md`:

```bash
premark -o presentation.html slides.md
```
