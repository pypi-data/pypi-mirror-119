EMHASS: Energy Management for Home Assistant

## Context

This module was conceived as an energy management optimization tool for residential electric power consumption and production systems.
The goal is to optimize the energy use in order to maximize autoconsumption.
The main study case is a household where we have solar panels, a grid connection and one or more controllable (and if possible deferrable) electrical loads. Including an energy storage system using batteries is also possible in the code.
The package is highly configurable with an object oriented modular approach and a main configuration file defined by the user.
EMHASS was designed to be integrated with Home Assistant, hence it's name. Installation instructions and exemple Home Assistant automation configurations are given below.

The main dependencies of this project are PVLib to model power from a PV residential installation and the PuLP Python package to perform the actual optimizations using the Linear Programming approach.

## Installation

It is recommended to install on a virtual environment.
For this you will need `virtualenv`, install it using:
```
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
```
Then create and activate the virtual environment:
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 emhassenv
cd emhassenv
source bin/activate
```
Install using the provided setup.py file:
```
python setup.py install
```
Or use the distribution files:
```
python3 -m pip install emhass
```
## Development

Update the build package:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```
And generate distribution archives with::
```
python3 -m build
```
To develop using Anaconda:
```
conda create --name emhass-dev python=3.8 pip=21.0.1
```
Then activate environment and install emhass using the provided setup.py file:
```
conda activate emhass-dev
python setup.py install
```
... or the compiled whl file:
```
pip install emhass-X.X.X-py3-none-any.whl
```
Add more packages if needed, this is optional if using spyder:
```
conda install spyder-kernels
```
