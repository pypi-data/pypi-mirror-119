## Usage

### Generate report for a dataset

`pyeda report <path-to-dataset>`

### Generate report for a dataset with a target variable

`pyeda target <path-to-dataset> <target-variable>`

### Generate comparison report between two datasets

`pyeda compare <path-to-dataset1> <path-to-dataset2>`

### Generate comparison report between two datasets with a target variable

`pyeda compare <path-to-dataset1> <path-to-dataset2> <target-variable>`
