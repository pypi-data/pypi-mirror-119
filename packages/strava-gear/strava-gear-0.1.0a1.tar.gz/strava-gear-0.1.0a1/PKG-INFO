Simple, yet powerful, local and open-source gear tracker for Strava. Uses
[strava-offline][] to keep a local database of activities and then reads
rules such as when a chain was replaced or that a certain hashtag means a
different set of wheels was used, and computes the wear (distance ridden and
time used) of all components.

Compared to [Strava My Gear][]:

* unlimited number of components
* tracks wear of components swapped from one bike to another, or taken off
  temporarily
* hashtags for temporary component changes (race wheels, bikepacking bags, …)
* easy and reversible editing of maintenance history (it's just YAML, and you
  can put it under [version control][git])
