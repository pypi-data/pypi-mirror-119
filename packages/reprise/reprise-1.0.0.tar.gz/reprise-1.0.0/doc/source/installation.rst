Installation
============

Supported systems and versions
------------------------------

*reprise* currently is only tested and mainly used on 64-bit Linux systems.
However, it is possible to install it on other operating systems, but be aware
that some functionality might not work or will not work as intended. Therefore
be extra careful and run the test suite after installing it on a non Linux
system.

.. note::

    We recommend to install `Minicoda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_
    before installing *reprise* or to create a virtualenv within your personal
    folder.


Linux
-----

If you want to install *reprise* on Linux the easiest way is to install it
from `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ with:

.. code:: bash

    pip install --user reprise
