Convenience functions for working with the Cmd module,
the BaseCommand class for constructing command line programmes,
and other command line related stuff.

*Latest release 20210913*:
New BaseCommand.apply_preargv method to gather special arguments before subcommands.

## Class `BaseCommand`

A base class for handling nestable command lines.

This class provides the basic parse and dispatch mechanisms
for command lines.
To implement a command line
one instantiates a subclass of `BaseCommand`:

    class MyCommand(BaseCommand):
        GETOPT_SPEC = 'ab:c'
        USAGE_FORMAT = r"""Usage: {cmd} [-a] [-b bvalue] [-c] [--] arguments...
          -a    Do it all.
          -b    But using bvalue.
          -c    The 'c' option!
        """
        ...

and provides either a `main` method if the command has no subcommands
or a suite of `cmd_`*subcommand* methods, one per subcommand.

Running a command is done by:

    MyCommand(argv).run()

or via the convenience method:

    MyCommand.run_argv(argv)

Modules which implement a command line mode generally look like this:

    ... imports etc ...
    ... other code ...
    class MyCommand(BaseCommand):
    ... other code ...
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(MyCommand.run_argv(sys.argv))

Instances have a `self.options` attribute on which optional
modes are set,
avoiding conflict with the attributes of `self`.

Subclasses with no subcommands
generally just implement a `main(argv)` method.

Subclasses with subcommands
should implement a `cmd_`*subcommand*`(argv)` method
for each subcommand.
If there is a paragraph in the method docstring
commencing with `Usage:`
then that paragraph is incorporated automatically
into the main usage message.
Example:

    def cmd_ls(self, argv):
        """ Usage: {cmd} [paths...]
              Emit a listing for the named paths.

            Further docstring non-usage information here.
        """
        ... do the "ls" subcommand ...

The subclass is customised by overriding the following methods:
* `apply_defaults()`:
  prepare the initial state of `self.options`
  before any command line options are applied.
* `apply_opt(opt,val)`:
  apply an individual getopt global command line option
  to `self.options`.
* `apply_opts(opts)`:
  apply the `opts` to `self.options`.
  `opts` is an `(option,value)` sequence
  as returned by `getopot.getopt`.
  The default implementation iterates over these and calls `apply_opt`.
* `cmd_`*subcmd*`(argv)`:
  if the command line options are followed by an argument
  whose value is *subcmd*,
  then the method `cmd_`*subcmd*`(subcmd_argv)`
  will be called where `subcmd_argv` contains the command line arguments
  following *subcmd*.
* `main(argv)`:
  if there are no command line aguments after the options
  or the first argument does not have a corresponding
  `cmd_`*subcmd* method
  then method `main(argv)`
  will be called where `argv` contains the command line arguments.
* `run_context()`:
  a context manager to provide setup or teardown actions
  to occur before and after the command implementation respectively,
  such as to open and close a database.

Editorial: why not arparse?
Primarily because when incorrectly invoked
an argparse command line prints the help/usage messgae
and aborts the whole programme with `SystemExit`.

### Method `BaseCommand.__init__(self, argv=None, *, cmd=None, **kw_options)`

Initialise the command line.
Raises `GetoptError` for unrecognised options.

Parameters:
* `argv`:
  optional command line arguments
  including the main command name if `cmd` is not specified.
  The default is `sys.argv`.
  The contents of `argv` are copied,
  permitting desctructive parsing of `argv`.
* `options`:
  a optional object for command state and context.
  If not specified a new `SimpleNamespace`
  is allocated for use as `options`,
  and prefilled with `.cmd` set to `cmd`
  and other values as set by `.apply_defaults()`
  if such a method is provided.
* `cmd`:
  optional command name for context;
  if this is not specified it is taken from `argv.pop(0)`.
Other keyword arguments are applied to `self.options`
as attributes.

The command line arguments are parsed according to
the optional `GETOPT_SPEC` class attribute (default `''`).
If `getopt_spec` is not empty
then `apply_opts(opts)` is called
to apply the supplied options to the state
where `opts` is the return from `getopt.getopt(argv,getopt_spec)`.

After the option parse,
if the first command line argument *foo*
has a corresponding method `cmd_`*foo*
then that argument is removed from the start of `argv`
and `self.cmd_`*foo*`(argv,options,cmd=`*foo*`)` is called
and its value returned.
Otherwise `self.main(argv,options)` is called
and its value returned.

If the command implementation requires some setup or teardown
then this may be provided by the `run_context`
context manager method,
called with `cmd=`*subcmd* for subcommands
and with `cmd=None` for `main`.

### `BaseCommand.OPTIONS_CLASS`

### Method `BaseCommand.__init_subclass__()`

Update subclasses of `BaseCommand`.

Appends the usage message to the class docstring.

### Method `BaseCommand.apply_defaults(self)`

Stub `apply_defaults` method.

Subclasses can override this to set up the initial state of `self.options`.

### Method `BaseCommand.apply_opt(self, *a, **kw)`

Handle an individual global command line option.

This default implementation raises a `RuntimeError`.
It only fires if `getopt` actually gathered arguments
and would imply that a `GETOPT_SPEC` was supplied
without an `apply_opt` or `apply_opts` method to implement the options.

### Method `BaseCommand.apply_opts(self, opts)`

Apply command line options.

### Method `BaseCommand.apply_preargv(self, argv)`

Do any preparsing of `argv` before the subcommand/main-args.
Return the remaining arguments.

This default implementation returns `argv` unchanged.

### Method `BaseCommand.cmd_help(argv)`

Usage: {cmd} [subcommand-names...]
Print the help for the named subcommands,
or for all subcommands if no names are specified.

### Method `BaseCommand.getopt_error_handler(cmd, options, e, usage)`

The `getopt_error_handler` method
is used to control the handling of `GetoptError`s raised
during the command line parse
or during the `main` or `cmd_`*subcmd*` calls.

The handler is called with these parameters:
* `cmd`: the command name
* `options`: the `options` object
* `e`: the `GetoptError` exception
* `usage`: the command usage or `None` if this was not provided

It returns a true value if the exception is considered handled,
in which case the main `run` method returns 2.
It returns a false value if the exception is considered unhandled,
in which case the main `run` method reraises the `GetoptError`.

This default handler issues a warning containing the exception text,
prints the usage message to standard error,
and returns `True` to indicate that the error has been handled.

To let the exceptions out unhandled
this can be overridden with a method which just returns `False`
or even by setting the `getopt_error_handler` attribute to `None`.

Otherwise,
the handler may perform any suitable action
and return `True` to contain the exception
or `False` to cause the exception to be reraised.

### Method `BaseCommand.run(self, **kw_options)`

Run a command.
Returns the exit status of the command.
May raise `GetoptError` from subcommands.

Any keyword arguments are used to override `self.options` attributes
for the duration of the run,
for example to presupply a shared `RunState` from an outer context.

If the first command line argument *foo*
has a corresponding method `cmd_`*foo*
then that argument is removed from the start of `argv`
and `self.cmd_`*foo*`(cmd=`*foo*`)` is called
and its value returned.
Otherwise `self.main(argv)` is called
and its value returned.

If the command implementation requires some setup or teardown
then this may be provided by the `run_context`
context manager method,
called with `cmd=`*subcmd* for subcommands
and with `cmd=None` for `main`.

### Method `BaseCommand.run_argv(argv, **kw)`

Create an instance for `argv` and call its `.run()` method.

### Method `BaseCommand.run_context()`

Stub context manager which surrounds `main` or `cmd_`*subcmd*.

### Method `BaseCommand.subcommand_usage_text(subcmd, fulldoc=False, usage_format_mapping=None)`

Return the usage text for a subcommand.

Parameters:
* `subcmd`: the subcommand name
* `fulldoc`: if true (default `False`)
  return the full docstring with the Usage section expanded
  otherwise just return the Usage section.

### Method `BaseCommand.subcommands()`

Return a mapping of subcommand names to class attributes
for attributes which commence with `cls.SUBCOMMAND_METHOD_PREFIX`
by default `'cmd_'`.

### Method `BaseCommand.usage_text(*a, **kw)`

Compute the "Usage:" message for this class
from the top level `USAGE_FORMAT`
and the `'Usage:'`-containing docstrings
from its `cmd_*` methods.

This is a cached method because it tries to update the
method docstrings after formatting, which is bad if it
happens more than once.

## Function `docmd(dofunc)`

Decorator for `cmd.Cmd` subclass methods
to supply some basic quality of service.

This decorator:
- wraps the function call in a `cs.pfx.Pfx` for context
- intercepts `getopt.GetoptError`s, issues a `warning`
  and runs `self.do_help` with the method name,
  then returns `None`
- intercepts other `Exception`s,
  issues an `exception` log message
  and returns `None`

The intended use is to decorate `cmd.Cmd` `do_`* methods:

    from cmd import Cmd
    from cs.cmdutils import docmd
    ...
    class MyCmd(Cmd):
        @docmd
        def do_something(...):
            ... do something ...
