Description: # nomenklatura
        
        Nomenklatura de-duplicates and integrates different [Follow the Money](https://followthemoney.rtfd.org/) entities. It serves to clean up messy data and to find links between different datasets.
        
        ## Design
        
        This package will offer an implementation of an in-memory data deduplication framework centered around the FtM data model. The idea is the following workflow:
        
        * Accept FtM-shaped entities from a given loader (e.g. a JSON file, or a database)
        * Build an in-memory inverted index of the entities for blocking
        * Generate merge candidates using the blocking index and FtM compare
        * Provide a file-based storage format for merge challenges and decisions
        * Provide a text-based user interface to let users make merge decisions
        
        Later on, the following might be added:
        
        * A web application to let users make merge decisions on the web
        * An implementation of the OpenRefine Reconciliation API based on the blocking index
        
        This will be done in typed Python 3.
