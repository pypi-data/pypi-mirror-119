A library of tools for creating/managing videos with metastimuli elements. 

The purpose of metastimuli is to improve information retention by providing peripheral feedback and stimuli. There is a broader and nuanced rationale justifying the use of metastimuli[1]. Those looking to exploit metastimuli should be mindful of a sense of location and space, as that is the undergirding principle.
