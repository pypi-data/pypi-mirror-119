Description: # Petzi backend for Taxi
        
        This is the Petzi backend for [Taxi](https://github.com/sephii/taxi). It
        exposes the `petzi` protocol to push entries to a Google spreadsheet.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ``` sh
        taxi plugin install petzi
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        First youâ€™ll need to generate a credentials file to be able to query the
        spreadsheets Google API. To do so, [follow the official
        guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials), and
        then follow the "Create Desktop application credentials" and download the JSON
        file with credentials.
        
        Once you have your JSON file with credentials, open your configuration file
        using `taxi config`, and add a backend using the `petzi` protocol for your
        backend. Use the path to the credentials JSON file and set the `sheet_id` in the
        query string.  For example:
        
        ```
        [backends]
        petzi = petzi:///home/sephi/credentials.json?sheet_id=22324_Xg40_x9iWrERPCeIhBFcfHuTWbzxtjrfwvZIQA
        ```
        
        ## Contributing
        
        To setup a development environment, create a virtual environment and run the
        following command in it:
        
        ``` sh
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        To use a specific version of Taxi, eg. if you need to also make changes to Taxi,
        install it in the virtual environment in editable mode:
        
        ``` sh
        pip install -e /path/to/taxi
        ```
        
        To run the tests, install the test requirements, and then run the `pytest` command:
        
        ``` sh
        pip install -r requirements_test.txt
        pytest
        ```
