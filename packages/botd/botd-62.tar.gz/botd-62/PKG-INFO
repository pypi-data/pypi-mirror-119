        SYNOPSIS

        DESCRIPTION
        ===========
        
        **BOTD** is a IRC bot that can run as a  background
        daemon for 24/7 a day presence in a IRC channel. You can use it to
        display RSS feeds, act as a UDP to IRC gateway, program your own
        commands for it and have it log objects on disk to search them. 
        
        **BOTD** an attempt to achieve OS level integration of bot technology directly
        into the operating system. A solid, non hackable bot version, that can offer
        "display in your irc channel" functionality to the unix programmer. BOTD
        runs on both BSD and Linux, is placed in the Public Domain, and, one day,
        will be the thing you cannot do without ;]
