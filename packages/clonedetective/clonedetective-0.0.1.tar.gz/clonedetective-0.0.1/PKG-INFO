        ## What does it do?
        
        **clonedetective** is a package for analysing fluorescent imaging data from cell lineage experiments (e.g. FLP-out, MARCM or Cre-lox clones).
        
        Outputted quantifications include:
        - counts of each cell type per “clone”
        - spatial metrics e.g. number of nearest neighbors of each cell per clone
        - cell and clone properties e.g. area, mean intensity etc.
        
        If clones label genetic mutations, these metrics can be useful in addressing biological questions such as:
        - does my gene of interest regulate clone size (i.e. cell proliferation) or clone composition (i.e. cell differentiation)?
        - does the local cell neighbourhood (e.g. number and type of neighbours) non-autonomously impact cell proliferation or differentiation? 
        - does my gene of interest regulate the expression of other (immunostained) proteins?
        
        ## Under the hood
        
        **clonedetective** is constructed using many amazing python libraries, including scikit-image, numpy, Xarray, pandas, numba, Dask, Dask-image and pyclesperanto-prototype.
        
        Many functions are lazy-loaded and parallelized using [Dask](https://dask.org/), enabling clonedetective to scale to large multi-dimensional datasets that do not fit in RAM.
