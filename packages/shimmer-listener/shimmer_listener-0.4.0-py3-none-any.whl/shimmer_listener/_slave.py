"""
Loosely based on the bluetoothMasterTest.py app from https://github.com/ShimmerResearch/tinyos-shimmer

We acquire data from the accelerometer and from the gyroscope modules on the mote, format them, and process
them via a process function. This approach can be used both for data to be locally transformed or for the data
to be forwarded to other apps (e.g. nodered)

This library is mainly used in master mode and its slave mode functionalities are limited to the bluetoothMasterApp.
