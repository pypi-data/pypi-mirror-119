"""
## shimmer-listener

This library allows you to connect to a Shimmer2/2r mote via Bluetooth both in Master and Slave
mode, interacting with the applications on the mote.

When communicating with a Shimmer mote using an app made with this library as the Bluetooth Master,
you have to implement the presentation protocol inside of the Shimmer nesC application. This protocol is a way
to inform the Bt Master about the data format used when sending messages.

## Presentation protocol

The protocol is implemented by sending a simple struct via Bluetooth as the very first message after successfully
establishing a connection with the Bt Master. Its format is the following:

```c
typedef char key_string[MAX_STR_LEN];

typedef struct {
    uint8_t framesize;
    uint8_t chunklen;
    char format[MAX_FMT_LEN];
    key_string keys[MAX_KEY_NUM];
} frameinfo;
```

The presentation frame is automatically interpreted from the BtStream, so you don't have to do anything from this side
of the communication.


## Callbacks


A series of callbacks can be used and set as properties to intercept certain events:

- **on_connect(mac: str, info: frameinfo) -> None**

    Called when a mote identified by **mac** succesfully connects. All the information
    regarding the exchanged data format, obtained through *the presentatin protocol* are
    accessible via **info**.

- **on_message(mac: str, frame: Dict[str, Any]) -> None**

    Called when a message is received from a mote identified by **mac**. The message is
    returned as a dict with the keys previously obtained from the *presentation protocol*.

- **on_disconnect(mac: str, lost: bool) -> None**

    Called when a mote identified by **mac** disconnects. If **lost** is true, the disconnect
    event happened because the connection has been lost.
