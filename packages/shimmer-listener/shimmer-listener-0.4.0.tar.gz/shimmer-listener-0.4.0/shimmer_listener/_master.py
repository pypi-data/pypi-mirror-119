"""
General idea:
- A thread keeps searching for bluetooth slaves that can be shimmer devices (*)
- When it finds 1+, it tries to pair with them, if it manages to, it spawns
    a new thread that manages the data transfer for that node.

(*) devices with an ID starting with "RN42" are shimmer devices
